	<dt class="question">
		<h2><span class="numeral">1.</span> When will I receive my order?</h2>
	</dt><!--/.question-->

	<dd class="answer">
		<p>Soon - really. Actually you should receive your order within 2 weeks, but likely much sooner.</p>

		<p>If you are purchasing something labeled “PRE-ORDER” then you will need to see the product description for when to expect your order, as you are purchasing something that has not actually been printed yet, or is still being made.</p>

		<p>Thank you for your patience, and if you have questions about where an order is, just <a href="info@devte.es">contact me</a>.</p>

	<dt class="question">
		<h2><span class="numeral">2.</span> What is your Returns Policy?</h2>
	</dt><!--/.question-->

	<dd class="answer">
		<p>I will accept returns only for fullfillment mistakes (i.e. you were sent the wrong size or design than what you actually ordered). Returns are only made for exchange of merchandise, not refunds.</p>

		<p>Returns can only be made within 30 days from purchase, and if you've already worn the product or washed it you can't return it.</p>

		<p>If you simply changed your mind about what you bought, or don't like it, I do apologize and suggest that you contact me so we can figure out how to make you happy.</p>

	<dt class="question">
		<h2><span class="numeral">3.</span> What does my shirt feel like? Who makes the shirts?</h2>
	</dt><!--/.question-->

	<dd class="answer">
		<p>The shirts are very soft, and printed on <a href="http://www.nextlevelapparel.com/Prod-24-1-30-2/mens-cvc-crew.htm">Next Level 6210</a> or <a href="http://www.tultex.net/0241/">Tultex 0241</a> (see shirt description for specifics).</p>
	</dd><!--/.answer-->



	<dt class="question">
		<h2><span class="numeral">4.</span> How do the shirts fit size-wise? Should I order a size larger or smaller?</h2>
	</dt><!--/.question-->

	<dd class="answer">
		<p>They fit pretty on par with most Tees, but slightly smaller. You might want to order a size larger if you don't like snug fitting shirts. Also, please refer to the sizing charts on the respective product page.</p>

	<dt class="question">
		<h2><span class="numeral">5.</span> Why are you doing this, and who is behind all of this?</h2>
	</dt><!--/.question-->

	<dd class="answer">
		<p>I'm behind all of this - with a little help from <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/aglovier" target="_blank">my wife</a>. I'm a designer/developer and I work full-time for <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>. Dev Tees is just a side project where I get to excercise some extra creativity.</p>

		<p>This project was also made possible by 469 wonderful backers on <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jag/dev-tees">Kickstarter</a></p>

	<dt class="question">
		<h2><span class="numeral">6.</span> What is your store built on?</h2>
	</dt><!--/.question-->

	<dd class="answer">
		<p><a href="http://bigcartel.com/" target="_blank">Big Cartel</a>. I've also used <a href="http://www.shopify.com/" target="_blank">Shopify</a> for the <a href="http://store.cure.org" target="_blank">CURE Store</a>, but settled on Big Cartel for my personal shop for a number of reasons, including price and not getting a special nonprofit rate for my personal work. Plus Big Cartel is pretty friendly for smaller, independent gigs like this.</p>

		<p>If you're really interested in a deeper review of Big Cartel, I can suggest <a href="http://www.fullstopinteractive.com/blog/2010/05/big-cartel-review/" target="_blank">this cool write up</a> by the fine folks over at <a href="http://www.unitedpixelworkers.com/" target="_blank">United Pixelworkers</a>.</p>

		<h2><span class="numeral">10.</span> Why is international shipping unavailable?</h2>
	</dt><!--/.question-->

	<dd class="answer">
		<p>I'm very sorry but international orders are temporarily unavailable. I've had considerable trouble with providing a solid customer experience to international customers due primarily to issues with shipping costs and reliability. At the moment I'm in search of a better solution, and as soon as I have it sorted international orders will be available again. I'm very sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
