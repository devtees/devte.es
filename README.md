devte.es Utility Repo
========

Currently I'm using this repo to track progress on upcoming t-shirt concepts.

In the future I'll also be publishing code here, such as the current site codebase.

## About Devte.es

Currently, [Dev Tees](http://devte.es) is a custom theme of a Big Cartel shop. I plan to extract the theme to an open source variant :soon:

## Suggest a shirt concept

Have a shirt concept you'd like to see Dev Tees print? [Open an issue](https://github.com/devtees/devte.es/issues) with the idea and we can hash out the concept together!
